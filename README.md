Character Swap
====================

This program can be used to swap the names and gendered pronouns of fictional 
characters in a novel to experience the book from a different perspective.

To change the book to be analyzed, add the book as a text file to the same 
file directory as the program, change the name and pronoun csv files to 
your liking, change the file name text strings, and rerun the program.
