Character Swap
====================

An entry in [NaNoGenMo 2015](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo-2015/).

This program can be used to swap the names and gendered pronouns of characters 
in a novel to experience the book from a different perspective.

The program creates four versions of any book:

* Opposite: where all the characters have been swapped to a version of themselves using the opposite pronouns. 
* They: where all the characters have been swapped to a version of themselves using they pronouns. 
* She: where all the characters have been swapped to a version of themselves using she pronouns. 
* He: where all the characters have been swapped to a version of themselves using he pronouns.

To change the book to be analyzed, create a folder for the book and add the book as a text file 
to that folder. Create a names folder inside the book folder and add four name csv files to that folder
with the character names and the name changes you'd like, and create a python file similar to holmesSwap.py 
in the book folder. Change the file name text in the main function in the python file to the name of the book, 
and run the program. The program takes around 30 minutes to complete all four versions.
