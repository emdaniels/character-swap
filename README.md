Character Swap
====================

An entry in [NaNoGenMo 2015](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo-2015/).

This program can be used to swap the names and gendered pronouns of characters 
in a novel to experience the book from a different perspective.

There are four versions of the book:

* [Opposite: The Adventures of Charlotte Holmes](https://github.com/emdaniels/character-swap/blob/master/Opposite_The_Adventures_of_Charlotte_Holmes.txt) 
where all the characters have been swapped to a version of themselves using the opposite pronouns.  

* [They: The Adventures of Hemlock Holmes](https://github.com/emdaniels/character-swap/blob/master/They_The_Adventures_of_Hemlock_Holmes.txt) 
where all the characters have been swapped to a version of themselves using they pronouns. 
    
* [She: The Adventures of Charlotte Holmes](https://github.com/emdaniels/character-swap/blob/master/She_The_Adventures_of_Charlotte_Holmes.txt) 
where all the characters have been swapped to a version of themselves using she pronouns. 
    
* [He: The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes](https://github.com/emdaniels/character-swap/blob/master/He_The_Adventures_of_Sherlock_Holmes.txt) 
where all the characters have been swapped to a version of themselves using he pronouns. 

To change the book to be analyzed, add the book as a text file to the same 
file directory as the program, change the name and pronoun csv files to 
your liking, change the file name text strings in the main, and rerun the program.
The program takes around 30 minutes to complete all four versions.
