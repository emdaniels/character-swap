Character Swap
====================

An entry in [NaNoGenMo 2015](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo-2015/).

This program can be used to swap the names and gendered pronouns of characters 
in a novel to experience the book from a different perspective.

The program creates four versions of any book:

* Opposite: where all the characters have been swapped to a version of themselves using the opposite pronouns. 
  *[Opposite: The Adventures of Charlotte Holmes](https://github.com/emdaniels/character-swap/blob/master/The_Adventures_Of_Sherlock_Holmes/Opposite_The_Adventures_of_Charlotte_Holmes.txt) 
  *[Opposite: Frankenstein](https://github.com/emdaniels/character-swap/blob/master/Frankenstein/Opposite_Frankenstein.txt)

* They: where all the characters have been swapped to a version of themselves using they pronouns. 
  *[They: The Adventures of Hemlock Holmes](https://github.com/emdaniels/character-swap/blob/master/The_Adventures_Of_Sherlock_Holmes/They_The_Adventures_of_Hemlock_Holmes.txt) 
  *[They: Frankenstein](https://github.com/emdaniels/character-swap/blob/master/Frankenstein/They_Frankenstein.txt)
    
* She: where all the characters have been swapped to a version of themselves using she pronouns.
  *[She: The Adventures of Charlotte Holmes](https://github.com/emdaniels/character-swap/blob/master/The_Adventures_Of_Sherlock_Holmes/She_The_Adventures_of_Charlotte_Holmes.txt) 
  *[She: Frankenstein](https://github.com/emdaniels/character-swap/blob/master/Frankenstein/She_Frankenstein.txt)
    
* He: where all the characters have been swapped to a version of themselves using he pronouns.
  *[He: The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes](https://github.com/emdaniels/character-swap/blob/master/The_Adventures_Of_Sherlock_Holmes/He_The_Adventures_of_Sherlock_Holmes.txt) 
  *[He: Frankenstein](https://github.com/emdaniels/character-swap/blob/master/Frankenstein/He_Frankenstein.txt) 

To change the book to be analyzed, create a folder and add the book as a text file 
to the folder, add name and pronoun csv files to the folder, and copy or create a
python file similar to holmesSwap.py in the same folder. Change the file name text 
strings in the main function in the python file to the name of the book, and run 
the program. The program takes around 30 minutes to complete all four versions.
